# Internship Project
### Over the Summer of 2021, I worked as engineering intern at Ametek Brookfield in Middleborough, MA. 
### This folder contains my final project presentation as well as video to go along with it.
### This was a in-house transducer test fixture that corrected micro-processor units as well as identified damaged/faulty transducers.
### The application was developed and executed with Python.

### Source Code for this project cannot be provided.

## Any further questions reach out to me by email: Brett_Beaulieu@student.uml.edu
