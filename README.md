# Internship Project
### Over the Summer of 2021, I worked as an Engineering Intern at Ametek Brookfield in Middleborough, MA. 
### This folder contains my final project presentation as well as video to show a test run of the application.
### This was an in-house transducer test fixture that corrected micro-controller units as well as identified damaged/faulty transducers.
### The application was developed and executed with Python.

### Source Code for this project cannot be provided.

## Any further questions reach out to me by email: Brett_Beaulieu@student.uml.edu
